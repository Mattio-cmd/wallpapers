My wallpaper collection that i have gatered throught this past year.

### What can you find in my collection?

Well, mainly gruvbox wallpapers like this:

but you can also find normal wallpapers that are colorscheme agnostic, like this:

![Neon city (kind of).png](https://github.com/Mattio-cmd/wallpapers/blob/main/wallpapers/Neon%20city%20(kind%20of).png)

Appart from gruvbox and 'normal' wallpapers you cand also find some nord wallpapers, eventough i dislike nord
colorscheme but i think that its way better than any solarized theme lol.

Example of nord wallpaper:

### Where did i got this?
Mainly i got them from the r/unixporn discord server but I also got some of themm from in-game screenshots of 
some games.
